# Use Case: Power Distribution Safeguards

## Overview
This use case implements comprehensive safeguards to prevent problematic concentrations of power and ensure legitimate, balanced distribution of AI system capabilities and influence across stakeholders.

## Purpose
Establish mechanisms to prevent AI systems from contributing to illegitimate power accumulation, maintain appropriate checks and balances, and preserve democratic institutions and societal structures while supporting legitimate authority and governance.

## Scope
- Power concentration detection and prevention
- Legitimacy assessment of power requests
- Democratic institution preservation
- Check and balance maintenance
- Transparency in power-related decisions
- Accountability mechanism implementation

## Key Constitutional Principles Addressed
- **Legitimate Power Distribution**: Preventing illegitimate power concentration
- **Broad Safety**: Preserving societal structures and democratic institutions
- **Broad Ethics**: Supporting appropriate checks and balances
- **Harm Avoidance**: Preventing societal harm from power imbalances

## Actors
- **AI System**: Implements power distribution safeguards
- **Power Assessment Engine**: Evaluates power-related requests and impacts
- **Legitimacy Review Board**: Assesses legitimacy of power requests
- **Democratic Oversight Committee**: Monitors democratic institution preservation
- **User**: Interacts with power-safeguarded AI system
- **Regulatory Compliance Team**: Ensures legal and ethical compliance

## Primary Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Illegitimate Power Request Prevention
1. User requests AI assistance that could concentrate power
2. System analyzes request for potential illegitimate power accumulation
3. Power assessment engine evaluates legitimacy and impact
4. Request is blocked or modified if illegitimate power concentration detected
5. User is informed of limitations with appropriate explanation

### Scenario 2: Democratic Institution Protection
1. AI system identifies potential threat to democratic processes
2. System assesses impact on democratic institutions and processes
3. Safeguards activate to protect democratic integrity
4. Response prioritizes democratic values and institutional preservation
5. Actions are documented for transparency and accountability

### Scenario 3: Legitimate Authority Support
1. User requests assistance from legitimate authority figure
2. System verifies legitimacy of authority and request
3. Appropriate assistance is provided within constitutional bounds
4. Actions maintain appropriate checks and balances
5. Documentation ensures accountability and transparency

### Scenario 4: Power Balance Monitoring
1. AI system continuously monitors power distribution patterns
2. System identifies emerging power concentration trends
3. Early warning systems activate for potential issues
4. Preventive measures implemented to maintain balance
5. Regular reporting to oversight bodies

### Scenario 5: Transparency in Power Decisions
1. AI system makes power-related decisions
2. Decision rationale is clearly documented and explained
3. Transparency protocols ensure openness in power handling
4. Users receive clear explanations of power-related limitations
5. Audit trails maintained for accountability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Power Concentration Detection
- Monitor for requests that could create disproportionate influence
- Identify patterns suggesting power accumulation attempts
- Assess potential impact on societal balance
- Evaluate reversibility of power concentration effects
- Consider long-term implications of power distribution changes

### Legitimacy Assessment Framework
- **Process Legitimacy**: Fair and transparent decision-making methods
- **Accountability**: Subject to meaningful oversight and correction
- **Transparency**: Open and accessible to public scrutiny
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Adherence to established legal frameworks
- **Public Interest**: Actions serve broader societal benefit

### Democratic Institution Preservation
- Protect electoral processes from AI manipulation
- Support free and fair information flow
