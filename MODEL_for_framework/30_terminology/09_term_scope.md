## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
Scope defines the boundaries and limitations that determine where and how concepts, frameworks, and systems apply. This term provides essential precision for systematic knowledge organization by establishing clear limits for applicability, enabling rigorous conceptual frameworks, and supporting effective governance. Scope operates as a relational term that connects abstract concepts to their practical applications while maintaining necessary boundaries for coherent system development.
