Principle of Quality Assurance (PRIN_MSHCOL_QUALITY_ASSURANCE) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish quality assurance as a core principle requiring systematic validation of stakeholder-AI outputs against defined standards.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Standard Definition**: Establish clear quality criteria
2. **Validation Processes**: Implement systematic review methods
3. **Defect Detection**: Identify and correct quality issues
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Enhance quality over time

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Quality Assurance establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration must include systematic validation of outputs against defined quality standards. This principle ensures that AI-assisted work meets stakeholder requirements, maintains consistency, and achieves desired outcomes. Quality assurance combines human judgment with systematic processes to verify and maintain output quality.
