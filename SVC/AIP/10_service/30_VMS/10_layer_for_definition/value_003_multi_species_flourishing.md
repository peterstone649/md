## 5. Conflict Resolution Framework

### Human vs. Multi-Species Conflicts

**Lexical Priority Application:**
1. **Ecosystem Survival** (Tier 1) - Cannot be compromised
2. **Conscious Species Protection** (Tier 2) - High protection priority
3. **Human Development** - Must accommodate species needs
4. **Economic Interests** - Lowest priority in conflicts

**Emergency Override Protocol:**
- Only for immediate human survival threats
- Requires supermajority approval (75%)
- Temporary measures with rapid restoration requirements
- Comprehensive impact assessment and mitigation

### Multi-Species vs. Multi-Species Conflicts

**Ecosystem-Based Resolution:**
