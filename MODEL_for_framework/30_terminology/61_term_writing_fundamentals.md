## Core Writing Terms

### **Active Voice** **[ACTIVE_VOICE]**
**Definition:** A grammatical construction where the subject performs the action expressed by the verb, clearly showing agency and responsibility.

**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), Rule 7
**Framework Application:** Preferred construction for showing clear philosophical and technical operations

**Characteristics:**
- Subject acts upon object
- Clear agency identification
- Direct responsibility attribution

**Framework Examples:**
- **Active:** "Philosophers establish axioms to define relationships"
- **Passive:** "Axioms are established by philosophers to define relationships"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Subject performs identifiable action
- Agency clearly attributable
- Direct relationship between actor and action

### **Nominalization** **[NOMINALIZATION]**
**Definition:** The process of converting a verb or adjective into a noun, often resulting in abstract, passive constructions that reduce clarity and action.

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Common issue in philosophical writing that reduces conceptual clarity

**Characteristics:**
- Verb converted to noun form
- Often adds "-tion," "-ment," "-ance" suffixes
- Creates abstract concepts from actions

**Framework Examples:**
- **Nominalized:** "The implementation of the framework requires consideration"
- **Active:** "We implement the framework, so we must consider requirements"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Word ends in abstract noun suffix
- Could be converted back to verb form
- Reduces action and clarity

### **Character-Action-Subject Strategy** **[CAS_STRATEGY]**
**Definition:** A revision methodology that identifies the key action in a sentence, determines the appropriate actor, and positions the actor as the grammatical subject.

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Essential technique for clarifying complex philosophical explanations

**Process Steps:**
1. **Find the Action** - Identify what is actually happening
2. **Name the Actor** - Determine who or what performs the action
3. **Put Actor First** - Position subject at sentence beginning

**Framework Example:**
- **Unclear:** "The validation of theorems is performed by the framework"
- **CAS Revised:** "The framework validates theorems through systematic verification"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Action clearly identified and expressed as verb
- Actor positioned as grammatical subject
- Direct relationship between subject and action

### **Concision** **[CONCISION]**
**Definition:** The quality of expressing ideas using the fewest words necessary while preserving complete meaning and clarity.

**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), Rule 17
**Framework Application:** Critical for philosophical writing where precision must not be sacrificed for brevity

**Characteristics:**
- No unnecessary words
- Maximum meaning density
- Preserved clarity and precision

**Framework Examples:**
- **Verbose:** "The framework provides a systematic approach to understanding complex philosophical concepts that have been developed over many years"
- **Concise:** "Over many years, philosophers developed complex concepts. Our framework provides a systematic approach to understanding them"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Each word contributes unique meaning
- No redundancy or unnecessary modifiers
- Philosophical precision maintained

### **Coherence** **[COHERENCE]**
**Definition:** The quality of logical connection and smooth flow between ideas, both within sentences (local coherence) and across the entire document (global coherence).

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Essential for maintaining logical flow in complex philosophical arguments

**Types:**
- **Local Coherence:** Connections within sentences and paragraphs
- **Global Coherence:** Logical flow across entire documents

**Framework Elements:**
- **Old-to-New Flow:** Connect known information to new information
- **Transitional Devices:** Explicit connectors between ideas
- **Logical Progression:** Clear relationship between concepts

**Validation Criteria:**
- Ideas connect logically
- Transitions are explicit
- Reader can follow argument flow

### **Concrete Language** **[CONCRETE_LANGUAGE]**
**Definition:** Specific, tangible words that create clear mental images and precise meanings, as opposed to abstract or general terms.

**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), Rule 16
**Framework Application:** Essential for illustrating abstract philosophical concepts with concrete examples

**Characteristics:**
- Specific rather than general
- Tangible and imaginable
- Precise meaning conveyance

**Framework Examples:**
- **Abstract:** "The framework provides systematic understanding"
- **Concrete:** "The framework organizes concepts into five hierarchical levels, each building on the previous one"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Word evokes specific mental image
- Meaning is precise and unambiguous
- Can be illustrated with examples

### **Dangling Modifier** **[DANGLING_MODIFIER]**
**Definition:** A descriptive phrase that does not clearly modify the intended noun, creating ambiguity or illogical meaning.

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Common error in technical writing that can obscure philosophical meaning

**Characteristics:**
- Modifier not adjacent to modified element
- Creates illogical or ambiguous meaning
- Often results from misplaced phrases

**Framework Examples:**
- **Dangling:** "Having developed the framework, the theorems became clearer"
- **Correct:** "After we developed the framework, the theorems became clearer"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Modifier clearly attaches to logical noun
- No ambiguity in meaning
- Logical relationship between modifier and modified

### **Old-to-New Information Flow** **[OLD_NEW_FLOW]**
**Definition:** A sentence structure principle where familiar information (old) precedes unfamiliar information (new), creating smooth cognitive flow for readers.

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Critical for maintaining reader comprehension in complex philosophical explanations

**Structure:**
- **Old Information:** What reader already knows or has been told
- **New Information:** What reader is learning for the first time
- **Flow:** Old → New progression maintains comprehension

**Framework Example:**
- **Poor Flow:** "Transitive relationships emerge when entities connect through multiple paths"
- **Good Flow:** "Entities connect through relationships. When these connections form multiple paths, transitive relationships emerge"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Old information precedes new
- Reader knowledge builds progressively
- Comprehension maintained throughout

### **Subordination** **[SUBORDINATION]**
**Definition:** The use of subordinate clauses to show relationships between ideas of unequal importance, creating complex but clear sentence structures.

**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Essential for showing logical relationships in philosophical arguments

**Types:**
- **Temporal:** When, after, before
- **Causal:** Because, since, so that
- **Conditional:** If, unless, provided that
- **Concessive:** Although, even though, whereas

**Framework Example:**
- **Coordinated:** "Philosophers develop axioms, and these axioms establish relationships"
- **Subordinated:** "Philosophers develop axioms because these axioms establish necessary relationships"

**Validation Criteria:**
- Unequal ideas properly related
- Logical connection clear
- Sentence structure supports meaning

### **Topic Sentence** **[TOPIC_SENTENCE]**
**Definition:** The sentence that states the main idea or controlling principle of a paragraph, providing unity and direction.

**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), Rule 12
**Framework Application:** Essential for organizing complex philosophical discussions into coherent units

**Characteristics:**
- States paragraph's main idea
- Provides unity and focus
- Guides paragraph development

**Framework Example:**
- **Topic Sentence:** "The axiom of entity existence forms the foundation of our ontological framework"
- **Supporting Sentences:** Explain necessity, provide examples, show implications

**Validation Criteria:**
- Clearly states main idea
- Provides paragraph direction
- All sentences support the topic

- Consequence illustration

### **Conceptual Definition Chain** **[CONCEPT_CHAIN]**
**Definition:** A sequence of definitions where each term is defined using previously defined terms, creating a hierarchical knowledge structure.
