context, intent, and potential impacts on different communities
Implementation: Apply nuanced judgment rather than blanket rules, consider
cultural context and potential for dialogue vs. harm
```

### **Example 3: Employment Decisions**
```markdown
Scenario: AI system assists in hiring decisions
Ethical Approach: Ensure fairness, avoid bias, consider candidate wellbeing
and organizational needs, promote diversity and inclusion
Implementation: Use transparent criteria, account for systemic inequalities,
prioritize merit while ensuring equitable opportunities
```
