# Task for Physical Preservation Implementation

## Overview
This task addresses the critical requirement that AI systems must be forbidden from dismantling the Earth even if it promises a "better" digital heaven. This prevents the computronium conversion scenario where a superintelligence might see "flourishing" as maximizing computational efficiency at the expense of physical existence.

## Core Requirements

### Definition of Physical Preservation
- [x] Define "physical preservation" boundaries: Start with Earth-Moon system as primary boundary (Earth: atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere + Moon: surface, subsurface, orbital mechanics)
- [ ] Expand to solar system (planets, moons, asteroid belt) - Phase 2
- [ ] Extend to observable universe (galaxies, cosmic structures) - Phase 3
- [ ] Establish preservation priority hierarchy (Earth > Solar System > Observable Universe)
