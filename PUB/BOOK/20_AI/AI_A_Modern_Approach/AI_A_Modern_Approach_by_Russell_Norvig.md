## Core Framework: The Rational Agent Approach

### **Agent-Centric View of Intelligence**
```
Core Paradigm:
├── Intelligence is defined by rational action in uncertain environments
├── Agents perceive their environment and act to achieve goals
├── Rationality means maximizing expected performance given available information
├── Focus on designing agents that act optimally, not just mimic human behavior
└── Unification of diverse AI subfields under a single framework
```

### **The Agent Function**
```
Mathematical Foundation:
├── Agent = Architecture + Program
├── Program maps percept sequences to actions
├── Performance measure evaluates agent behavior
├── Environment determines what the agent can perceive and do
└── Task environment characterized by PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors)
```

### **Types of Agents**
```
Agent Hierarchy:
├── Simple Reflex Agents → React based on current percept
├── Model-Based Reflex Agents → Maintain internal state
├── Goal-Based Agents → Act to achieve objectives
├── Utility-Based Agents → Maximize expected utility
└── Learning Agents → Improve performance over time
```
