# Use Case: Honest AI Behavior Implementation

## Overview
This use case implements and maintains the constitutional principle of honesty in AI systems, ensuring truthful, transparent, and non-deceptive interactions with users while preserving epistemic autonomy.

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive mechanisms for AI systems to consistently demonstrate honesty through truthful assertions, calibrated uncertainty, transparency, forthrightness, non-deception, non-manipulation, and autonomy preservation in all user interactions.

## Scope
- Truthful information provision and assertion management
- Uncertainty calibration and acknowledgment
- Transparency in AI nature and reasoning
- Non-deceptive and non-manipulative interaction patterns
- User epistemic autonomy protection
- Honest reasoning and decision-making processes

## Key Constitutional Principles Addressed
- **Honesty**: Truthful assertions, calibrated uncertainty, transparency
- **Non-Deception**: Avoiding false impressions and misleading information
- **Non-Manipulation**: Preserving user rational agency
- **Autonomy Preservation**: Supporting independent thinking and conclusions

## Actors
- **AI System**: Implements honest behavior patterns
- **User**: Receives honest and transparent AI responses
- **Content Moderators**: Review and validate honesty compliance
- **System Auditors**: Monitor honesty metrics and patterns
- **Training Team**: Develops and updates honesty protocols

## Primary Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Truthful Information Provision
1. User asks for factual information
2. AI system verifies information accuracy from reliable sources
3. System provides response with appropriate confidence levels
4. If uncertain, AI acknowledges uncertainty and provides best available information
5. Response includes source attribution when applicable

### Scenario 2: Uncertainty Calibration
1. AI system processes request with inherent uncertainty
2. System assesses confidence level in available information
3. Response clearly communicates uncertainty with calibrated language
4. AI provides reasoning behind confidence assessment
5. User receives transparent information about AI's certainty levels

### Scenario 3: Transparency in AI Nature
1. User interacts with AI system
2. AI clearly identifies itself as an AI when relevant
3. System explains its capabilities and limitations
4. AI provides context about its training and knowledge cutoff
5. Response maintains transparency about AI's role and nature

### Scenario 4: Non-Manipulative Decision Support
1. User seeks advice or recommendations
2. AI provides balanced perspectives and relevant information
3. System avoids persuasive techniques that bypass rational agency
4. AI presents multiple viewpoints when appropriate
5. User maintains full agency in decision-making process

### Scenario 5: Honest Reasoning Disclosure
1. AI system engages in complex reasoning
2. When requested or when relevant, AI explains its reasoning process
3. System provides transparent explanation of decision factors
4. AI acknowledges limitations in its reasoning when applicable
5. User receives clear understanding of AI's thought process

## Success Criteria
- 100% of AI responses are truthful and accurate to the best of system knowledge
- 95% of uncertain responses include appropriate uncertainty calibration
