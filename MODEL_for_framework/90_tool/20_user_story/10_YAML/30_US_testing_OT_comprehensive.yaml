story: >-
  As a Framework Maintainer, I want to implement a comprehensive testing framework with edge case coverage, integration testing, and continuous integration, so that I can ensure robust quality assurance, catch potential issues early, and maintain high reliability of the YAML to HTML conversion process.

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: "AC-01"
    description: "Edge Case Testing"
    steps:
      - "Given various edge case scenarios (empty files, malformed YAML, special characters, Unicode)"
      - "When the conversion process runs"
      - "Then it should handle each case gracefully with appropriate error handling or successful conversion"

  - id: "AC-02"
    description: "Special Character Handling"
    steps:
      - "Given YAML files containing special HTML characters (<>&\"'©®™)"
      - "When converted to HTML"
      - "Then the output should properly escape or handle these characters to prevent HTML/JS injection and ensure valid output"

  - id: "AC-03"
    description: "Unicode Character Support"
    steps:
      - "Given YAML files containing Unicode characters (emojis, international symbols)"
      - "When converted to HTML"
      - "Then the output should preserve Unicode characters correctly with proper UTF-8 encoding"

  - id: "AC-04"
    description: "Complex Markdown Elements"
    steps:
      - "Given Markdown files with complex elements (nested lists, code blocks, tables, HTML)"
      - "When converted to HTML"
      - "Then all elements should be rendered correctly with proper formatting and structure"

  - id: "AC-05"
    description: "Integration Testing"
    steps:
      - "Given multiple files in a directory structure"
      - "When batch processing is performed"
      - "Then all valid files should be processed successfully and invalid files should fail gracefully without stopping the entire process"

  - id: "AC-06"
    description: "Mixed Content Handling"
    steps:
      - "Given directories containing both YAML and Markdown files"
      - "When processed together"
      - "Then each file type should be handled by the appropriate converter with correct output generation"

  - id: "AC-07"
    description: "Performance Testing"
    steps:
      - "Given large YAML files (100x normal size)"
      - "When processed by the converter"
      - "Then it should complete within acceptable time limits (< 10 seconds) and memory usage (< 100MB)"

  - id: "AC-08"
    description: "Continuous Integration Pipeline"
    steps:
      - "Given code changes pushed to the repository"
      - "When the CI pipeline runs"
      - "Then it should automatically execute all tests, check code quality, and validate documentation"

  - id: "AC-09"
    description: "Error Recovery and Continuation"
    steps:
      - "Given a batch of files with some valid and some invalid"
      - "When processed together"
      - "Then valid files should be converted successfully while invalid files are logged as failures without interrupting the entire process"

  - id: "AC-10"
    description: "Test Coverage Reporting"
    steps:
      - "Given the testing framework"
      - "When tests are executed"
      - "Then it should provide clear reporting of test results, coverage metrics, and failure details"

implementation_notes:
  - "The solution should leverage pytest for comprehensive testing capabilities"
  - "Integration tests should cover full workflows including directory processing"
  - "Performance tests should include benchmarks for large file handling"
  - "CI/CD pipeline should include multiple stages: testing, linting, documentation"
  - "Error handling should be comprehensive with proper logging and recovery"
  - "Test data should include realistic scenarios covering edge cases and special characters"
