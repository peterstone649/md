Principle of Iterative Validation (PRIN_MSHCOL_ITERATIVE_VALIDATION) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish iterative validation as a core principle requiring systematic human review at critical checkpoints throughout stakeholder-AI collaboration.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Checkpoint Integration**: Build validation points into collaborative workflows
2. **Progressive Assurance**: Increase validation rigor at key transitions
3. **Error Detection**: Identify and correct issues before they propagate
4. **Quality Preservation**: Maintain output quality through structured review

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Iterative Validation establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration must include systematic human review at defined checkpoints throughout the workflow. Rather than relying solely on final review, this principle builds validation into the process itself, catching errors early and ensuring that AI-assisted outputs meet stakeholder requirements at each stage. Iterative validation combines human judgment with AI capability to produce higher quality outcomes.

## 2. Core Definitions

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Iterative Validation** | Systematic review at defined checkpoints | Draft → Review → Approval → Final |
| **Checkpoint** | A designated review point in workflow | Post-draft review before expansion |
| **Progressive Assurance** | Increasing rigor through stages | Light review → Deep review → Audit |

## 4. Rules and Guidelines

### 4.1 Validation Checkpoints

| Stage | Validation Type | Reviewer | Criteria |
|-------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Concept** | Feasibility Review | Domain Expert | Scope defined, assumptions clear |
| **Draft** | Content Review | Stakeholder | Requirements met, quality adequate |
| **Review** | Quality Review | QA Team | Standards compliance, accuracy |
| **Final** | Approval Review | Owner | Complete, approved, ready for use |

### 4.2 Implementation Requirements
1. **Define Checkpoints**: Identify critical review points in each workflow
2. **Assign Reviewers**: Designate responsible reviewers for each checkpoint
3. **Set Criteria**: Establish clear validation criteria for each stage
4. **Document Outcomes**: Record validation results and decisions
