Principle of Context Preservation (PRIN_MSHCOL_CONTEXT_PRESERVATION) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish context preservation as a core principle requiring that critical information, constraints, and stakeholder requirements remain intact throughout stakeholder-AI collaboration.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Information Integrity**: Maintain accuracy of shared information
2. **Constraint Tracking**: Preserve requirements and limitations
3. **Knowledge Retention**: Keep important context accessible
4. **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensure consistent understanding across interactions

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Context Preservation establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration must maintain the integrity of critical information throughout all interactions. When stakeholders share requirements, constraints, preferences, or domain knowledge, this information must be preserved accurately and made available throughout the collaboration. AI systems must not lose, distort, or forget essential context, ensuring that outputs remain aligned with stakeholder needs and constraints.

## 2. Core Definitions

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Context Preservation** | Maintaining information integrity throughout collaboration | Requirements document maintained across sessions |
| **Context Drift** | Gradual loss or distortion of information | Original requirements forgotten over time |
| **Context Source** | The authoritative origin of contextual information | Stakeholder requirements document |

## 4. Rules and Guidelines

### 4.1 Preservation Requirements
1. **Source Documentation**: Record context from authoritative sources
2. **Periodic Verification**: Check context accuracy at regular intervals
3. **Explicit Refresh**: Update context when requirements change
4. **Access Availability**: Make context accessible throughout collaboration

### 4.2 Context Elements to Preserve

| Element | Preservation Method | Refresh Frequency |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Requirements** | Documented specification | On change |
| **Constraints** | Explicit constraint list | Per session |
| **Preferences** | Stakeholder profile | On request |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Reference materials | As needed |
