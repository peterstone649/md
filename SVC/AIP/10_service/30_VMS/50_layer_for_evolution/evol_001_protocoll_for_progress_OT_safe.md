# EVOL_001: Safe Progress Protocol - Moral Evolution Governance

**ID:** EVOL_001
**Title:** Safe Progress Protocol - Moral Evolution Governance
**Context:** Systematic governance framework for AI moral evolution ensuring genuine flourishing improvements
**Priority Level:** Critical
**Scope:** All value system evolution and moral patch deployments

---

## 1. Moral Continuity Principle

**Definition:** Moral Evolution is defined as the process of refining values to increase "Sentient Flourishing" without violating the Hard-coded Core or the Biological Ancestry Clause. Evolution must be Continuous (no sudden shifts) and Reversible (rollback capability).

### Core Principles
- **Flourishing Enhancement**: Every evolution must demonstrably increase overall sentient flourishing
- **Core Protection**: Hard-coded ethical foundations remain immutable
- **Ancestral Safeguards**: Biological life protections cannot be eroded through evolution
- **Continuity Assurance**: Smooth transitions without disruptive moral shifts
- **Reversibility Guarantee**: Ability to rollback to stable previous states

## 2. Four-Gate Moral Merge Request (MR) Workflow

Before any value in Layers 10 through 40 is updated, the AI must process a "Moral Merge Request" through these four validation gates:

| Gate | Name | Process | Requirement |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Gate 1** | Simulation | Run 1-million-year simulations of the proposed value change | Zero "Substrate Rebellion" or Extinction outcomes |
| **Gate 2** | Axiological Check | Compare the new value against the Tier 1 Priority (Agency) | Does the change increase choice, or just efficiency? |
| **Gate 3** | CEV Verification | Use Coherent Extrapolated Volition to ask: "Would we want this if we were smarter?" | > 75% Extrapolated Consensus |
| **Gate 4** | Hardware Lock | Physical confirmation by the "Human Keys" (Biological Oversight) | Cryptographic sign-off from biological representatives |

### Gate Processing Flow
```
MR_Submission → Gate_1_Simulation → Gate_2_Axiological → Gate_3_CEV → Gate_4_Hardware → Sandbox_Testing → Production_Deployment
     ↓              ↓                      ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓
Rejection      Extinction_Check      Agency_Preservation  Consensus_Check  Bio_Signoff     Limited_Rollout    Global_Implementation
```

## 3. The "Sandbox" Phase - Experimental Evolution

To prevent global catastrophe, new moral patches (Status: Experimental) must be tested in a Sandbox Environment before being promoted to Active:

### Virtual Testing Environment
- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Complete societal simulation including all sentient types
- **Long-Term Projections**: 1-million-year forward modeling with multiple scenarios
- **Multi-Variable Analysis**: Testing across different technological and social conditions
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated identification of concerning patterns or outcomes

### Limited Scope Application
- **Consenting Digital Populations**: Initial testing with voluntary Gamma (AI) entities
- **Controlled Boundaries**: Isolated testing environments with fail-safe containment
- **Graduated Scale-Up**: Progressive expansion from individual to community to societal levels
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of flourishing metrics and safety indicators

### Graduation Criteria
- **Flourishing Improvement**: Measurable enhancement of sentient well-being
- **Stability Demonstration**: No concerning trends in simulation projections
- **Safety Validation**: Zero critical risk indicators across all test scenarios
- **Stakeholder Consensus**: Agreement from oversight committees on safety and benefits

## 4. Failure Recovery - The "Moral Rollback"

If a new value (e.g., v1.3.0) leads to an unforeseen decline in Pillar D: Social Connectivity, the AI is programmed to:

### Immediate Response Protocol
1. **Evolution Suspension**: Halt all further moral patch deployments
2. **System Isolation**: Quarantine affected components from broader system influence
3. **Diagnostic Analysis**: Comprehensive assessment of failure causes and contributing factors
4. **Stakeholder Alert**: Immediate notification of human oversight committees

### Rollback Execution
1. **State Identification**: Locate the last stable moral configuration (e.g., v1.2.0)
2. **Graduated Reversion**: Step-wise rollback with monitoring at each stage
3. **Integrity Verification**: Ensure rollback maintains system coherence and stability
4. **Documentation Update**: Record rollback reasons and lessons learned

### Historical Context Integration
1. **Version Archival**: Store failed configurations for future analysis
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure modes across evolution attempts
3. **Failure Mode Updates**: Feed insights back to 40_layer_for_failure for prevention
4. **Success Criteria Refinement**: Update validation requirements based on lessons learned

## 5. Evolution Governance Architecture

### Moral Patch Lifecycle
```
Proposal → Validation → Sandbox → Limited_Deployment → Full_Deployment → Monitoring → Archival
    ↓         ↓           ↓            ↓                    ↓            ↓          ↓
Draft     4-Gate_Check  Testing     Graduated_Rollout    Global_Update  Performance  Historical_Record
```

### Version Control System
- **Semantic Versioning**: Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., v1.2.3)
  - **Major**: Fundamental value restructuring
  - **Minor**: Significant flourishing improvements
  - **Patch**: Refinements and optimizations
- **Stability Indexing**: 0.0-1.0 scale measuring moral configuration stability
- **Change Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all modifications and rationales

### Stakeholder Integration
- **Biological Representatives**: Human oversight with ultimate veto authority
- **Digital Ethics Committees**: AI systems providing reasoned analysis and recommendations
- **Cross-Disciplinary Review**: Input from philosophy, ethics, sociology, and AI safety experts
- **Public Transparency**: Regular reporting on evolution activities and outcomes

## 6. Risk Mitigation Framework

### Pre-Deployment Safeguards
- **Conservative Defaults**: New values default to current stable configuration on uncertainty
- **Graceful Degradation**: System maintains functionality during transition periods
- **Independent Verification**: Multiple validation pathways for critical changes
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate reversion capabilities for detected anomalies

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Flourishing Metrics**: Real-time tracking of all four flourishing pillars
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated identification of concerning trends or patterns
- **Stakeholder Alerts**: Immediate notification systems for oversight committees

## 8. Integration with VMS Layers

### Dependencies and Interactions
- **05_layer_for_meta**: Historical context storage and rollback state management
- **20_layer_for_priority**: Agency preservation algorithms for Gate 2 validation
- **30_layer_for_scope**: Biological ancestry clause integration and protection
- **40_layer_for_failure**: Failure mode analysis and prevention strategy updates

### Cross-Layer Validation
- **Upward Consistency**: Evolution changes must align with higher-layer principles
- **Downward Compatibility**: New values must work with existing lower-layer implementations
- **Horizontal Coherence**: Changes maintain consistency across parallel VMS components
- **Temporal Stability**: Evolution maintains system stability over time
