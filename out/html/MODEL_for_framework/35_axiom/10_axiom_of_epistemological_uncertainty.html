    <h1>01. Rule of Epistemological Uncertainty <strong>[RULE_EPISTEMOLOGICAL_UNCERTAINTY]</strong> <strong>[PRIO: CRITICAL]</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Version: V0.1.0</strong> <strong>Date: 2026-01-08</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule:</strong> All human and AI statements possess intrinsic limitations and a degree of irreducible uncertainty, requiring systematic consideration of these imperfections in all communications, analyses, and decision-making processes.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The rule of epistemological uncertainty establishes that no statement, whether from human or artificial intelligence, can be considered complete, unbiased, or certain. All statements contain complementary uncertainties in accuracy, completeness, bias, and context that must be systematically acknowledged and addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Statement:</strong> ∀s∃u∃f∃l (Statement(s) → ∃u∃f∃l (Uncertainty(u) ∧ Flaws(f) ∧ Limitations(l) ∧ MustConsider(s, u) ∧ MustConsider(s, f) ∧ MustConsider(s, l)))</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Foundation:</strong> Based on cognitive bias research, and empirical studies of communication limitations, supported by analysis of epistemological constraints in human and artificial cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong> No statement is absolute; all communications have uncertainties; systematic uncertainty consideration required; humility in knowledge claims essential.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Communication protocols, decision-making frameworks, AI system design, scientific methodology, policy development, interpersonal relations.</li>
<li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Ignoring epistemological uncertainty leads to overconfidence, flawed decisions, and systemic errors; embracing uncertainty enables more robust and reliable outcomes.</li>
