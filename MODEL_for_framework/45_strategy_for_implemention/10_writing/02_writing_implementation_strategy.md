**Methodology:**
1. **Assessment:** Identify passive voice usage in existing documents
2. **Training:** Teach active voice conversion techniques
3. **Application:** Apply active voice rules to new writing
4. **Validation:** Verify 80% active voice achievement

**Framework-Specific Application:**
- Philosophical operations: "Philosophers establish axioms"
- Technical processes: "Framework validates theorems"
- System descriptions: "Components interact through interfaces"

#### **Nominalization Elimination**
**Methodology:**
1. **Detection:** Identify noun forms of verbs (-tion, -ment, -ance)
2. **Conversion:** Transform to active verb constructions
3. **Validation:** Ensure clarity improvement maintained

**Framework Examples:**
```
Before: "The implementation of the framework requires consideration"
After: "We implement the framework, so we must consider requirements"
```

#### **Concrete Language Strategy**
**Methodology:**
1. **Abstract Identification:** Find general/abstract terms
2. **Concrete Replacement:** Substitute specific, tangible terms
3. **Example Addition:** Provide concrete illustrations

**Framework Application:**
```
Abstract: "Framework provides systematic validation"
Concrete: "Framework validates theorems using three steps: premise checking, logical operation verification, and conclusion validation"
```

**Framework Application:**
- Philosophical arguments: Build from foundational concepts
- Technical explanations: Progress from simple to complex
- Process descriptions: Follow logical operational sequence

#### **Topic Sentence Strategy**
**Methodology:**
1. **Paragraph Analysis:** Identify main ideas for each paragraph
2. **Topic Statement:** Create clear topic sentences

Topic Sentence: "The axiom of entity existence forms our ontological foundation"
Supporting Sentences: Definition, necessity, examples, implications
```

### **Concision Implementation Strategy** **[CONCISION_STRATEGY]**

#### **Word Elimination Process**

3. **Validation Testing:** Confirm meaning preservation

**Framework Guidelines:**
- Each word must contribute unique meaning
- Philosophical precision maintained
