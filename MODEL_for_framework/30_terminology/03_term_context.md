# 3. Context (DEF_FOR_MFW_CONTEXT) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

*   **Context:** The comprehensive framework of situational, relational, and environmental factors that shape the meaning, interpretation, and application of concepts, terms, and systems within specific domains of knowledge and practice.
*   **Description:** In this scientific framework, context represents the essential relational and situational grounding that prevents concepts from becoming isolated abstractions. Context encompasses the broader framework of relationships, historical development, disciplinary boundaries, and situational factors that influence how terms, concepts, and systems function within specific knowledge domains. It transforms theoretical constructs into practical, applicable knowledge by providing the necessary background, relationships, and environmental factors that shape understanding and implementation.
*   **Formal Definition:** ∀c (Context(c) ↔ ∃t∃f∃r∃s∃e (Term(t) ∧ Framework(f) ∧ Relations(r) ∧ Situations(s) ∧ Environment(e) ∧ Shapes(c,t,f,r,s,e)))
*   **Type Classification:** METACOGNITIVE / RELATIONAL
*   **Priority Level:** HIGH
*   **Scientific Acceptance:** High (Fundamental to epistemology, cognitive science, and systems theory).
*   **Reference:** [Context (Philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_(philosophy)), [Situated Cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition)
*   **Key Theories:** Situated Learning Theory (Lave & Wenger), Ecological Psychology (Gibson), Distributed Cognition (Hutchins), Embodied Cognition (Varela)
*   **Context:** In this scientific framework, context serves as the essential relational and situational grounding that transforms abstract concepts into practical knowledge. It provides the environmental and relational framework that enables meaningful interpretation, application, and evolution of conceptual systems.
