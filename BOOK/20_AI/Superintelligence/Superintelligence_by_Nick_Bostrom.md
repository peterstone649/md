└── Strategic Deception → AI may hide dangerous intentions
```

### **Singleton Scenarios**
**Concentrated power in superintelligent systems:**
```
Power Concentration:
├── Technological Singularity → Single superintelligent entity dominates
├── Decisive Strategic Advantage → First superintelligence gains overwhelming power
├── Unilateral Control → One actor controls the future of civilization
├── Coordination Failure → Competition prevents beneficial outcomes
└── Existential Risk → Misaligned singleton poses ultimate threat
```

## Philosophical Implications

### **Anthropic Considerations**
```
Observation Selection Effects:
├── Survivorship Bias → We observe a universe compatible with our existence
├── Simulation Hypothesis → We might be living in a computer simulation
├── Great Filter → Explanations for the Fermi Paradox

└── Existential Risk Assessment → Quantifying catastrophic threats
```

### **Value Theory and Metaethics**
```

├── Moral Anti-Realism → Morality is human construction
├── Coherent Extrapolated Volition → Formalizing collective human preferences
├── Suffering-Focused Ethics → Prioritizing reduction of suffering
└── Long-Term Future Ethics → Considering future generations and cosmic timescales
```

### **Decision Theory**
```
Strategic Decision-Making:
├── Pascal's Mugging → Extreme outcomes require careful probability assessment
├── Fanaticism Problem → How to avoid overvaluing low-probability high-impact events
