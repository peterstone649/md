# 11. Principle of Bias Mitigation (PRIN_MSHCOL_BIAS_MITIGATION) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish bias mitigation as a core principle requiring active detection and correction of AI-generated biases in stakeholder-AI collaboration.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Bias Detection**: Identify AI-generated biases
2. **Active Correction**: Implement bias correction measures
3. **Awareness Raising**: Increase stakeholder awareness of bias risks
4. **Fairness Assurance**: Ensure equitable treatment across stakeholders

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Bias Mitigation establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration must include active measures to detect and correct biases in AI-generated outputs. AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. This principle requires systematic bias detection, diverse perspective incorporation, and ongoing correction to ensure fair and equitable collaborative outcomes.
