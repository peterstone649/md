## Core Writing Principles

### **Principle 1: Clarity Through Action**
**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Transform abstract philosophical concepts into active, demonstrable actions

#### **Character-Action-Subject Strategy**
1. **Identify the Action** - Determine what is actually happening in the concept
2. **Name the Actor** - Specify who or what performs the action
3. **Position Actor First** - Place the subject at the beginning of sentences

**Framework Example:**
- **Unclear:** "The validation of the theorem was performed by the framework"
- **Clear:** "The framework validates theorems through systematic verification"

#### **Active Voice Preference**
- **Preferred:** Use active voice to show clear agency
- **Framework Rule:** Use active voice in 80% of sentences unless passive is required for emphasis
- **Exception:** Passive voice acceptable when actor is unknown or irrelevant

### **Principle 2: Concision and Economy**
**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White), Rule 17
**Framework Application:** Eliminate unnecessary words while preserving philosophical precision

#### **Omit Needless Words**
- **Target:** Remove redundant phrases and unnecessary modifiers
- **Framework Rule:** Each word must contribute unique meaning or clarity
- **Validation:** Can any word be removed without losing essential meaning?

**Examples:**
- **Wordy:** "The framework provides a systematic approach to understanding complex philosophical concepts that have been developed over many years"
- **Concise:** "Over many years, philosophers have developed complex concepts. Our framework provides a systematic approach to understanding them"

#### **Nominalization Elimination**
- **Issue:** Converting verbs to nouns reduces clarity and action
- **Solution:** Convert nouns back to verbs when possible
- **Framework Rule:** Avoid unnecessary nominalizations in technical explanations

### **Principle 3: Coherence and Flow**
**Source:** "Style: Toward Clarity and Grace" (Williams)
**Framework Application:** Ensure logical progression in complex philosophical arguments

#### **Old-to-New Information Flow**
- **Old Information:** What readers already know
- **New Information:** What readers are learning
- **Framework Rule:** Connect old information to new information smoothly

#### **Transitional Elements**
- **Required:** Use explicit connectors between related ideas
- **Types:** Logical connectors (therefore, however, consequently)
- **Framework Rule:** Every paragraph transition must be explicit

### **Principle 4: Precision and Propriety**
**Source:** "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White)
**Framework Application:** Use precise language appropriate for philosophical and technical content

#### **Definite, Specific, Concrete Language**
- **Preferred:** Concrete terms over abstract generalizations
- **Framework Rule:** Define abstract terms with concrete examples
- **Validation:** Can the concept be illustrated with a specific example?

#### **Proper Case and Agreement**
- **Subject-Verb Agreement:** Number agreement between subject and verb
- **Pronoun Case:** Correct use of nominative and objective cases
- **Framework Rule:** All grammatical rules apply unless clarity demands exception

## Framework-Specific Writing Standards

### **Philosophical Writing Conventions**

#### **Theorem Presentations**
- **Structure:** State theorem, provide proof sketch, give concrete example
- **Clarity:** Use active voice to show logical operations
- **Precision:** Define all technical terms on first use

#### **Axiom Descriptions**
- **Format:** State axiom, explain necessity, provide justification
- **Action:** Show axioms "establishing" relationships rather than being "established"
- **Flow:** Connect axioms to their consequences immediately

#### **Conceptual Definitions**
- **Method:** Define by function before form
- **Examples:** Provide concrete illustrations of abstract concepts
- **Relationships:** Explicitly state how concepts interrelate

### **Technical Documentation Standards**

#### **Process Descriptions**
- **Active Agents:** Name who performs each step
- **Sequential Logic:** Use clear temporal connectors (first, then, finally)
- **Validation Points:** Include verification steps in process descriptions

#### **System Architecture**
- **Component Actions:** Describe what components do, not what they are
- **Data Flow:** Show how information moves through active processes
- **Integration Points:** Clearly identify how components interact

### **Quality Assurance Guidelines**

#### **Clarity Checklist**
- [ ] Subject performs action in active voice
- [ ] Modifiers placed near modified elements
- [ ] Related ideas connected with transitions
- [ ] Unnecessary words eliminated
- [ ] Abstract concepts illustrated with examples

#### **Coherence Validation**
- [ ] Old information connects to new information
- [ ] Paragraph unity maintained
- [ ] Logical flow throughout document
- [ ] Reader comprehension prioritized

#### **Professional Standards**
- [ ] Jargon defined on first use
- [ ] Complex sentences broken when clarity demands
- [ ] Technical accuracy maintained
- [ ] Reader-focused perspective preserved
