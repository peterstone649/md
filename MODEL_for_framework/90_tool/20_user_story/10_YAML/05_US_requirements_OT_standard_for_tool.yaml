story: >-
  As a Framework Developer, I want all tools and components to follow standard framework requirements, so that I can ensure consistency, maintainability, and proper integration across the entire framework.

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: "AC-01"
    description: "Folder Structure Standards"
    steps:
      - "Given a new tool or component is added to the framework"
      - "When it is implemented"
      - "Then it should follow the established folder structure with source code in appropriate tool directories, tests in corresponding tests/ subdirectories, documentation in 20_user_story/ with YAML files, and HTML output in parallel html/ directory structure"

  - id: "AC-02"
    description: "HTML Output Organization"
    steps:
      - "Given HTML files are generated from Markdown or YAML"
      - "When the conversion process runs"
      - "Then the HTML files should be organized in a parallel directory structure maintaining the same relative path structure"

  - id: "AC-03"
    description: ".env Configuration Support"
    steps:
      - "Given tools require project base path configuration"
      - "When the tool is executed"
      - "Then it should read PROJECT_BASE_PATH from the .env file with default E:/2025_11/_29/ and use this as the root path for all file operations"

  - id: "AC-04"
    description: "Configuration File Handling"
    steps:
      - "Given tools need configuration"
      - "When configuration files are required"
      - "Then they should follow these standards using .env for environment variables, .yaml or .json for structured configuration, support both absolute and relative paths, and provide sensible defaults"

  - id: "AC-05"
    description: "Error Handling and Logging"
    steps:
      - "Given tools encounter errors"
      - "When errors occur during execution"
      - "Then they should log detailed error messages with context, provide user-friendly error messages, include stack traces for debugging, support different log levels, and write logs to appropriate output"

  - id: "AC-06"
    description: "Cross-Platform Compatibility"
    steps:
      - "Given the framework runs on different platforms"
      - "When tools are developed"
      - "Then they should use cross-platform path handling, support both Windows and Unix path separators, handle line endings appropriately, and use platform-independent file operations"

  - id: "AC-07"
    description: "Documentation Standards"
    steps:
      - "Given new features or tools are added"
      - "When they are implemented"
      - "Then they should include comprehensive user stories, code documentation, usage examples, changelog entries for all modifications, and related documents references"

  - id: "AC-08"
    description: "Testing Requirements"
    steps:
      - "Given new functionality is added"
      - "When it is implemented"
      - "Then it should include unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for workflows, edge case testing, performance benchmarks where applicable, and test coverage reporting"

  - id: "AC-09"
    description: "Versioning and Changelog"
    steps:
      - "Given components are modified"
      - "When changes are made"
      - "Then they should follow semantic versioning, update changelog with version date changes, document stakeholder and rationale, and maintain version history"

  - id: "AC-10"
    description: "Framework Integration"
    steps:
      - "Given tools are part of the framework"
      - "When they are developed"
      - "Then they should use consistent naming conventions, follow established patterns, integrate with existing framework components, support framework-wide configuration, and maintain consistency with other tools"

implementation_notes:
  - "All tools should be designed with these standards in mind from the beginning"
  - "Existing tools should be gradually migrated to comply with these standards"
  - "Standards should be documented and easily accessible to all developers"
  - "Compliance with standards should be part of code review process"
  - "Standards may evolve over time but should maintain backward compatibility"
