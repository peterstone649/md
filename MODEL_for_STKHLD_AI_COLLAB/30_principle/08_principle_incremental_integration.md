**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish incremental integration as a core principle requiring gradual AI capability introduction with continuous monitoring and adjustment.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Gradual Adoption**: Introduce AI capabilities progressively
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track AI performance and impact
3. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Modify AI involvement based on results
4. **Safe Experimentation**: Enable learning without excessive risk

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Incremental Integration establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration should introduce AI capabilities gradually, with continuous monitoring and the ability to adjust involvement levels. Rather than comprehensive AI deployment, this principle advocates for starting with limited AI roles, measuring outcomes, and expanding AI involvement only when effectiveness is demonstrated.

## 4. Integration Phases

| Phase | AI Role | Human Role | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **1: Observation** | Suggest, no action | Review suggestions | Relevance assessed |
| **2: Limited Action** | Draft, human approves | Review and modify | Quality acceptable |
| **3: Extended Action** | Execute with oversight | Monitor and intervene | Reliability demonstrated |
