## MODEL_for_framework Specific Adaptations

### **Framework Integration Notes**

MODEL_for_framework adapts the following elements from the base methodology:

| Component | Base Framework | MODEL_for_framework Adaptation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| AI Tools | e.g. Grok (xAI) via CLINE | Same toolset used |
| Collaboration Model | Stakeholder-AI Partnership | Same model applied |
| Quality Assurance | Stakeholder Validation | Same validation processes |
| Transparency | Full disclosure required | Same transparency standards |

### **Specific MODEL_for_framework Considerations**

- **Convention-Based Development**: All MODEL_for_framework components follow the convention system defined in `20_convention/` directory
- **Template Standardization**: Uses templates from `15_template/` for consistent document structure
- **Terminology Consistency**: Terminology defined in `30_terminology/` ensures framework-wide consistency

---

## Conclusion

The **MODEL_for_framework** fully adopts the stakeholder-AI collaboration methodology from **MODEL_for_stakeholder_AI_collab** as its foundation. All AI assistance practices, transparency commitments, and quality assurance processes are aligned with this base framework.
