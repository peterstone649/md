# Fallback Preservation [PRINC_FOR_STKHLD_AICOL_FALLBACK_PRESERVATION] **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**We establish fallback preservation as a core principle requiring that human capability and manual processes be maintained as fallback when AI systems fail.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Human Capability Retention**: Maintain skills even with AI assistance
2. **Manual Process Preservation**: Keep non-AI processes operational
3. **Failure Recovery**: Enable continued operation during AI failures
4. **Autonomy Protection**: Ensure stakeholders can operate independently

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Fallback Preservation establishes that stakeholder-AI collaboration must maintain human capabilities and manual alternatives as fallback options when AI systems fail or become unavailable. This principle prevents over-dependence on AI by ensuring stakeholders retain the ability to accomplish tasks without AI assistance. Fallback preservation is essential for resilience and autonomy.
