# System [DEF_FOR_MFW_SYSTEM] [PRIO: HIGH]

*   **Term:** A system is an organized collection of interrelated components that work together to achieve a common purpose or function.
*   **Description:** Systems are fundamental organizational units that transform inputs into outputs through coordinated interactions between components. They maintain boundaries, exhibit emergent properties, and can be analyzed at multiple levels of complexity.
*   **Formal Definition:** ∀s (System(s) ↔ ∃c∃i∃o∃p (Components(c,s) ∧ Interactions(i,s) ∧ Outputs(o,s) ∧ Purpose(p,s) ∧ Organized(s,c,i,o,p)))
*   **Type Classification:** CONCEPTUAL
*   **Priority Level:** HIGH
*   **Scientific Acceptance:** High (Fundamental to systems theory, cybernetics, and interdisciplinary analysis).
*   **Reference:** [Systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) (WP), [General systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_systems_theory) (WP)
*   **Key Theories:** General Systems Theory (von Bertalanffy), Cybernetics (Wiener), Complex Systems (Holland)
*   **Context:** In this scientific framework, systems provide the conceptual foundation for understanding organized complexity, emergent behavior, and hierarchical organization across all domains of knowledge.

## System Characteristics

### **Structural Elements**
- **Components**: Individual parts that make up the system
- **Relationships**: Connections and interactions between components
- **Boundaries**: Clear delineation of what is inside vs. outside the system
- **Hierarchy**: Nested levels of organization and complexity

### **Functional Properties**
- **Inputs**: Resources or information entering the system
- **Processes**: Transformations that occur within the system
- **Outputs**: Results or products generated by the system
- **Feedback**: Information loops that regulate system behavior

### **Emergent Properties**
- **Holism**: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- **Self-Organization**: Systems can reorganize themselves in response to changes
- **Adaptation**: Systems can modify their behavior based on experience
- **Resilience**: Ability to maintain function despite disturbances

## System Types

### **Open vs. Closed Systems**
- **Open Systems**: Exchange matter, energy, and information with their environment
- **Closed Systems**: Exchange only energy with their environment
- **Isolated Systems**: No exchange with their environment

### **Simple vs. Complex Systems**
- **Simple Systems**: Linear relationships, predictable behavior
- **Complex Systems**: Non-linear relationships, emergent behavior, adaptive capacity

## Confidence Assessment

**Term Definition Confidence:** 0.90 (High)
- **Rationale:** Well-established concept in systems theory with broad interdisciplinary application
- **Validation:** Supported by extensive literature across multiple scientific disciplines
- **Contextual Stability:** Core concept applicable to physical, biological, social, and artificial systems
- **Practical Application:** Essential for understanding organized complexity and system design
