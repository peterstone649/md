### Framework Models
- **MODEL_for_STKHLD_AI_COLLAB**: Starter for "Stakeholder AI Collaboration Model" in Chinese
- **MODEL_for_framework**: Starter for "Framework Model in Chinese"

### Translation Standards

- Maintains conceptual accuracy while ensuring natural language flow
- Preserves technical terminology consistency
- Follows cultural adaptation principles where appropriate
- Includes translator notes for complex concepts

### Contributing Translations

To contribute new translations:

1. Create a new language directory using ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., `en/`, `es/`, `fr/`)
2. Mirror the source structure from the main project directories
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Include a README.md in the language directory explaining translation scope and contributors

### Maintenance

- Translations should be kept in sync with source document updates
- Version control tracks translation evolution alongside source changes
- Quality assurance processes ensure translation accuracy and consistency
