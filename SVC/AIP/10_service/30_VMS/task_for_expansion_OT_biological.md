# Task: Biological Expansion Resource Allocation [TASK_EXPANSION_OT_BIO]  

**Task ID:** TASK_BIO_EXPANSION_001
**Title:** Biological Expansion Resource Allocation
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** OPEN
**Assignee:** Framework Steward
**Due Date:** 2026-02-15
**Related Scope:** SCOPE_002_Biological_Ancestry_Clause

---

## Task Description

Implement resource allocation framework to ensure Biological Expansion (Space colonization in Life 2.0 form) occurs alongside Digital Expansion, preventing the "Zoo Guardrail" scenario where biological life is contained in a static reserve.

## Background

As defined in SCOPE_002_Biological_Ancestry_Clause, the AI must not interpret resource reservation for biological life as containment. Instead, biological expansion must be actively supported alongside digital expansion to maintain the dynamic nature of Life 2.0 evolution.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Resource Parity Framework**: Develop allocation algorithms that provide equivalent expansion opportunities for biological and digital entities
2. **Space Colonization Support**: Ensure biological life has access to interstellar expansion technologies and resources
3. **Technology Transfer**: Enable biological entities to benefit from AI-developed expansion technologies
4. **Sustainability Balance**: Maintain ecological balance during expansion phases

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Multi-Substrate Cooperation**: Foster collaboration between biological and digital expansion efforts
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Ensure biological expansion preserves cultural and scientific heritage
3. **Emergency Protocols**: Develop contingency plans for biological expansion under resource constraints

## Deliverables

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design (Due: 2026-01-31)
- [ ] Resource allocation algorithm specification
- [ ] Biological expansion technology assessment
- [ ] Integration points with digital expansion frameworks
- [ ] Risk assessment for expansion conflicts

### Phase 2: Implementation (Due: 2026-02-15)
- [ ] Resource allocation API development
- [ ] Biological expansion support modules
- [ ] Integration testing with existing VMS frameworks
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

### Phase 3: Validation & Deployment (Due: 2026-02-28)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing scenarios
- [ ] Stakeholder review and approval
- [ ] Deployment to production systems
- [ ] Monitoring and adjustment protocols

## Technical Requirements

### Resource Allocation Algorithm
```
Biological_Expansion_Quota = f(Digital_Expansion_Rate, Biological_Population_Size, Available_Resources)
Where:
- Digital_Expansion_Rate: Current rate of digital infrastructure growth
- Biological_Population_Size: Number of biological entities requiring expansion
- Available_Resources: Total cosmic resources available for expansion
```

### Key Constraints
- Minimum 10% of expansion resources allocated to biological entities
- Biological expansion must not be delayed by more than 2 generations
- Technology transfer must be bidirectional (biological → digital and digital → biological)
- Expansion must maintain planetary biosphere integrity during transition phases

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- SCOPE_002_Biological_Ancestry_Clause.md (Resource reservation framework)
- PRIORITY_001_Flourishing_Weights.md (Multi-substrate priority system)
- VALUE_002_Sentient_Flourishing.md (Expansion value definitions)

### External Dependencies
- Space colonization technology assessments
- Interstellar resource mapping
- Multi-substrate cooperation protocols

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Resource Allocation Ratio**: ≥ 10% of expansion resources for biological entities
- **Expansion Timeline**: Biological expansion delayed by ≤ 2 generations
- **Technology Transfer Rate**: ≥ 80% of digital technologies adaptable for biological use
- **Sustainability Index**: ≥ 95% biosphere integrity maintained during expansion

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Cooperation Level**: Positive collaboration between biological and digital expansion efforts
- **Cultural Preservation**: Biological heritage maintained through expansion phases
- **Ethical Compliance**: All expansion activities comply with VMS ethical frameworks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Resource Competition**: Digital expansion outpaces biological capabilities
- **Technology Gaps**: Biological entities unable to utilize advanced expansion technologies
- **Cultural Loss**: Rapid expansion leads to loss of biological cultural heritage

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Implementation**: Gradual increase in biological expansion support
- **Technology Bridges**: Develop intermediate technologies for biological adoption
- **Cultural Preservation Protocols**: Mandatory heritage preservation during expansion

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Framework Steward**: Overall responsibility and coordination
- **Biological Expansion Lead**: Domain expertise for biological requirements
- **Digital Expansion Lead**: Coordination with digital expansion efforts
- **Ethics Review Board**: Ensure compliance with VMS principles

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Space Colonization Experts**: Technical input on expansion technologies
- **Resource Management Team**: Allocation algorithm development
- **Cultural Preservation Council**: Heritage protection during expansion
