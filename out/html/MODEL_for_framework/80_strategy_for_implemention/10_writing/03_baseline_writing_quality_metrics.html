<li><strong>Total Word Count:</strong> ~4,200 words across analyzed documents</li>
<li><strong>Assessment Dimensions:</strong> Clarity, coherence, concision, active voice, concrete language</li>
<li><strong>Quality Framework:</strong> Professional writing standards for philosophical and technical content</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Assessment Methodology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative Metrics:</strong> Measurable ratios and percentages</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative Analysis:</strong> Subjective quality evaluation</li>

<p><strong>Implementation Strategy:</strong>
1. <strong>Identify Passive Constructions:</strong> Search for "is/are + past participle" patterns
2. <strong>Find the Actor:</strong> Determine who/what performs the action
3. <strong>Reposition Subject:</strong> Place actor at sentence beginning
4. <strong>Verify Clarity:</strong> Ensure active voice improves comprehension</p>
<p><strong>Expected Impact:</strong>
