  As a Framework Documenter,
  I want the HTML conversion tool to automatically find and convert
  any linked Markdown documents that it references,
  so that I can be confident all local links will work correctly
  in the final HTML output without having to convert each file manually.

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: "01"
    steps:
      - "Given I convert a single Markdown file (A.md),"
      - "And A.md contains a relative link to another Markdown file (B.md),"
      - "When the conversion process runs,"
      - "Then both A.html and B.html should be generated in the correct output directory."
  - id: "02"
    steps:
      - "Given a linked document (B.md) has already been converted in the same process (e.g., it was also linked from another file),"
      - "When the converter encounters the link to B.md again,"
      - "Then it should not re-convert it, to avoid redundant processing."
  - id: "03"
    steps:
      - "Given a file contains a link to a non-Markdown file (e.g., an image or a PDF),"
      - "When the conversion process runs,"
      - "Then the link should be preserved in the final HTML, but no conversion should be attempted on the linked file."
  - id: "04"
    steps:
      - "Given a file contains a link to an external website (e.g., https://...),"
      - "When the conversion process runs,"
      - "Then the external link should be preserved without any processing."
  - id: "05"
    steps:
      - "Given this feature is active,"
      - "When I use the existing --recursive flag on a directory,"
      - "Then both the recursive directory scan and the linked-document scan should work together, ensuring all documents are found and converted."
