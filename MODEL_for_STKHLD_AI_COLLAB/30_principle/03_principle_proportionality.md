# 3. Principle of Proportionality (PRIN_MSHCOL_PROPORTIONALITY) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Status: OPEN** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**We establish proportionality as a core principle requiring that AI assistance levels match task complexity, risk, and stakeholder needs.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Appropriate Sizing**: Match AI capability to task requirements
2. **Risk Alignment**: Scale AI involvement according to risk levels
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid over-reliance on AI for simple tasks
4. **Human Retention**: Ensure human involvement in proportion to task significance

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Proportionality establishes that in stakeholder-AI collaboration, the level of AI assistance must be appropriate to the task at hand. Simple, low-risk tasks may require minimal AI involvement, while complex, high-stakes decisions warrant careful human oversight and limited AI augmentation. This principle prevents both under-utilization of AI capabilities and over-dependence on AI systems, ensuring optimal human-AI task allocation.

## 1. Scope and Applicability

### 1.1 When to Apply
- Task complexity varies significantly
- Risk levels differ across collaborative activities
- Resource constraints require optimization
- Multiple AI involvement options exist

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Task planners and coordinators
- Stakeholders allocating AI resources
- AI tool administrators
- Risk managers

## 2. Core Definitions

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Proportionality** | Matching AI involvement to task requirements | Minimal AI for simple document formatting |
| **Task Complexity** | The degree of difficulty and interconnectedness | Multi-domain analysis vs. grammar check |
| **Risk Level** | Potential impact of errors or failures | Financial decisions vs. content suggestions |

## 4. Rules and Guidelines

### 4.1 Proportionality Matrix

| Risk Level | Task Complexity | AI Involvement | Human Oversight |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Low** | Simple | High | Minimal |
| **Low** | Complex | Moderate | Required |
| **High** | Simple | Moderate | Required |
| **High** | Complex | Minimal | Intensive |

### 4.2 Implementation Requirements
1. **Task Assessment**: Evaluate complexity and risk before AI allocation
2. **Proportion Calculation**: Determine appropriate AI/human balance
3. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust involvement as task evolves
4. **Documentation**: Record proportionality decisions and rationale
