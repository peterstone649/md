- **High Consciousness Species**: Mammals, birds, cephalopods with self-awareness
- **Social Complexity**: Species with advanced social structures and relationships
- **Pain Perception**: Species with demonstrated pain response and suffering capacity
- **Intelligence and Learning**: Species with advanced cognitive capabilities

**Tier 3: Biodiversity Maintenance (Medium Priority)**
- **Species Diversity**: Overall species count and variety preservation
- **Habitat Diversity**: Variety of ecosystem types and niches
- **Functional Diversity**: Range of ecological roles and functions
- **Population Viability**: Minimum viable population sizes for all species

**Tier 4: Human Development (Lower Priority)**
- **Sustainable Development**: Human needs met within ecological limits
- **Economic Activity**: Economic systems compatible with biodiversity
- **Cultural Values**: Human cultural practices that support conservation
- **Technological Progress**: Innovation that enhances rather than harms biodiversity

## 2. Priority Conflict Resolution

### Ecosystem vs. Human Conflicts

**Lexical Priority Application:**
1. **Ecosystem Survival** (Tier 1) - Cannot be compromised except for immediate human survival
2. **Conscious Species Protection** (Tier 2) - High protection priority, human activities must accommodate
3. **Human Development** (Tier 4) - Must operate within ecosystem and species protection constraints

**Decision Matrix:**
```
Conflict Type: Ecosystem vs. Human Development
Priority Resolution:
├── Ecosystem Integrity: PROTECTED (cannot be compromised)
├── Keystone Species: PROTECTED (cannot be compromised)  
├── Conscious Species: HIGH PROTECTION (human activities must adapt)
└── Human Development: ADAPTIVE (must work within ecological constraints)
```

### Multi-Species vs. Multi-Species Conflicts

**Ecosystem-Based Resolution:**
- **Keystone Species Priority**: Species critical to ecosystem function take precedence
- **Genetic Diversity Preservation**: Rare genetic material protected over common species
- **Ecosystem Stability**: Overall ecosystem health prioritized over individual species
- **Recovery Potential**: Species with higher recovery potential prioritized for intervention

## 3. Implementation Protocols

### AI System Integration

**Priority Assessment Algorithm:**
```
Multi-Species Priority Assessment:
1. Identify affected species and ecosystem components
2. Classify each according to priority tiers

4. Generate conflict resolution recommendations
5. Implement protection measures with ecosystem override capability
```

- **Intervention Triggers**: Automatic activation of protection protocols

### Policy Integration

**Legal Framework Requirements:**
- **Ecosystem Rights**: Legal recognition of ecosystem survival rights
- **Species Protection Laws**: Binding protection for Tier 1 and Tier 2 species
- **Development Constraints**: Human development must pass multi-species priority review
- **Emergency Override Protocols**: Strict limitations on human override capabilities

**Economic Integration:**
- **Ecosystem Services Valuation**: Economic recognition of ecosystem value
- **Biodiversity Impact Assessment**: Mandatory assessment for all development projects
- **Conservation Incentives**: Economic rewards for multi-species priority compliance
- **Pollution Penalties**: Heavy penalties for violations of priority hierarchy

## 4. Emergency Override Protocols

### Human Survival Override

**Override Conditions (Strictly Limited):**
- **Immediate Survival Threat**: Direct, immediate threat to human life
- **No Alternative Solutions**: No viable alternatives that protect ecosystem
- **Temporary Measures Only**: Override only for duration of emergency
- **Rapid Restoration Required**: Immediate restoration plan mandatory

**Override Authorization:**
- **Supermajority Requirement**: 75% approval from international oversight body
- **Scientific Review**: Independent scientific assessment of necessity
- **Public Transparency**: Full disclosure and public consultation
- **Restoration Commitment**: Binding commitment to full ecosystem restoration

**Override Limitations:**
- **Scope Limitation**: Override only for specific, identified threat
- **Time Limitation**: Maximum 6-month duration with automatic review
- **Scale Limitation**: Minimal necessary impact on ecosystem
- **Restoration Requirement**: 100% ecosystem restoration within 2 years
