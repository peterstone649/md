# 11. Convention for Confidence Scoring **[CONV_FOR_MODELFW_CONFIDENCE_SCORING]** **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V0.1.0** **Date: 2026-01-08**

**Purpose:** Establish standardized confidence scoring criteria for framework components to ensure credible, differentiated, and evidence-based confidence assessments.

## Confidence Score Scale

| Score | Level | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **0.95+** | Very High | Strong empirical validation, multiple independent confirmations, peer-reviewed consensus |
| **0.85-0.94** | High | Theoretical foundation + some empirical support, limited independent validation |
| **0.70-0.84** | Moderate | Theoretical foundation only, limited empirical validation |
| **0.50-0.69** | Low | Preliminary, significant uncertainty, emerging theoretical support |
| **<0.50** | Very Low | Speculative, limited theoretical basis, no empirical validation |

## Confidence Assessment Criteria

### For Axioms:
- **0.93-0.95**: Strong philosophical foundation, multiple supporting frameworks, extensive logical analysis
- **0.85-0.92**: Solid theoretical basis, some empirical correlation, limited validation studies
- **0.70-0.84**: Conceptual framework, theoretical rationale, minimal validation
- **0.50-0.69**: Emerging hypothesis, limited supporting evidence

### For Terms:
- **0.90-0.95**: Well-established in literature, widely accepted definition
- **0.80-0.89**: Standard definition, multiple authoritative sources
- **0.65-0.79**: Emerging usage, limited consensus
- **0.50-0.64**: Novel or contested concept

### For Strategies:
- **0.85-0.93**: Proven methodology, multiple successful implementations
- **0.75-0.84**: Established approach, some case studies
- **0.60-0.74**: Theoretical framework, limited practice
- **0.45-0.59**: Novel approach, experimental

## Confidence Assessment Format

```
**Component Confidence:** [SCORE] ([LEVEL])
- **Rationale:** [2-3 sentences explaining evidence basis]
- **Validation:** [Description of validation methods]
- **Contextual Stability:** [How stable is this assessment]
- **Practical Application:** [Relevance for practitioners]
```

## Differentiation Guidelines

**Do NOT assign the same confidence score to all components.**
- Base scores on actual evidence available
- Higher scores require stronger justification
- Acknowledge uncertainty where evidence is limited
- Differentiate between theoretical and empirical support

**Convention Reference:** Apply to all axiom, term, and strategy documents in MODEL_for_framework.
