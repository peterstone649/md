# 01. Framework Methodology to SVC-AIP Inheritance Mapping into System VMS **[DOMAIN_INTEGRATION_MODEL_FOR_FRAMEWORK_SVC_AIP_VMS]**

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the critical inheritance relationship between **MODEL_for_framework** (Framework Methodology) and **SVC/AIP** (Service AI Portal), demonstrating how methodological foundations fundamentally inform and enhance the VMS (Value Management System) implementation. The integration reveals that systematic AI service development is not merely a set of tools, but the systematic realization of methodological principles through structured inheritance patterns.
