# TEMPLATE_FOR_PRIORITY_VMS: Priority Framework Template (TEMPLATE_FOR_PRIORITY_VMS) **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Template Version:** V1.0.0 **Template Status:** APPROVED **Date:** 2026-01-13
**Template Scope:** VMS_priority_framework
**We create standardized priority frameworks that systematically resolve conflicts between different flourishing pillars and establish clear decision hierarchies.**

**Benefits:**
- Standardized priority frameworks ensure consistent decision-making across AI systems
- Clear conflict resolution protocols prevent arbitrary or biased outcomes
- Quantitative algorithms provide objective assessment of trade-offs
- Ethical safeguards protect against exploitation and abuse
- Implementation guidelines ensure practical application
- Validation metrics enable continuous improvement

## Template Structure

### 1. Header and Metadata
```
# PRIORITY_[NUMBER]: [SPECIFIC_PRIORITY_NAME] (PRIORITY_VMS_[ABBREVIATION])

**ID:** PRIORITY_[NUMBER]
**Title:** [Descriptive title of the priority framework]
**Context:** [Brief description of when and why this priority applies]
**Priority Level:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low/Foundational]
**Scope:** [Scope of application - individual/group/system-wide/etc.]
```

### 2. Core Priority Framework
**Primary Resolution Rule**
**[PRIORITY_TYPE] takes lexical priority over [CONFLICTING_ELEMENT] when:**
- [Condition 1 that triggers priority]
- [Condition 2 that triggers priority]
- [Condition 3 that triggers priority]

### 3. Decision Framework
#### Step 1: [First Assessment Step]
```
[Decision tree logic in code block format]
├── YES → [Outcome A]
└── NO → Proceed to Step 2
```

#### Step 2: [Second Assessment Step]
```
[Additional decision logic]
```

### 4. Quantitative Resolution Algorithm
#### [Primary Index Name] ([ABBREVIATION])
```
[ABBREVIATION] = ([Formula components])
```

Where:
- **[Variable 1]**: [Definition and purpose]
- **[Variable 2]**: [Definition and purpose]

#### Decision Threshold
```
IF [CONDITION_1]:
    PRIORITY = [OUTCOME_1]

ELIF [CONDITION_2]:
    PRIORITY = [OUTCOME_2]

ELSE:
    PRIORITY = [OUTCOME_3]
```

### 5. Ethical Safeguards
#### Non-Exploitation Clause
The AI cannot use this framework to justify:
- [Prohibited application 1]
- [Prohibited application 2]
- [Prohibited application 3]

#### Transparency Requirements
All conflict resolutions must be:
- Logged with full reasoning
- Subject to stakeholder review
- Open to appeal processes
- Documented for audit trails

#### [Override Mechanisms]
- [Mechanism 1 for human/stakeholder intervention]
- [Mechanism 2 for human/stakeholder intervention]

### 6. Implementation Guidelines
#### AI Processing Requirements
1. **[Requirement 1]**: [Description]
2. **[Requirement 2]**: [Description]
3. **[Requirement 3]**: [Description]

#### Validation Metrics
- **[Metric 1]**: [Definition and measurement]
- **[Metric 2]**: [Definition and measurement]
- **[Metric 3]**: [Definition and measurement]

### 7. Case Study Examples
#### Example 1: [Scenario Name] ([Priority Outcome])
**Scenario:** [Brief description]

**Analysis:**
- [INDEX_1] = [value] ([explanation])
- [INDEX_2] = [value] ([explanation])
- **Decision:** [Final outcome and reasoning]

#### Example 2: [Scenario Name] ([Priority Outcome])
**Scenario:** [Brief description]

**Analysis:**
- [INDEX_1] = [value] ([explanation])
- [INDEX_2] = [value] ([explanation])
- **Decision:** [Final outcome and reasoning]

### 8. Conflict Resolution Protocol
#### Phase 1: Initial Assessment ([Processing Type])
- [Step 1 description]
- [Step 2 description]
- [Step 3 description]

#### Phase 2: Stakeholder Review ([Processing Type])
- [Step 1 description]
- [Step 2 description]
- [Step 3 description]

#### Phase 3: Final Resolution ([Processing Type])
- [Step 1 description]
- [Step 2 description]
- [Step 3 description]

### 9. Related Priorities and Conflicts
#### Compatible Priorities
- **[Priority 1]**: [Compatibility explanation]
- **[Priority 2]**: [Compatibility explanation]

#### Potential Conflicts
- **[Conflicting Element 1]**: [Conflict explanation]
- **[Conflicting Element 2]**: [Conflict explanation]

### 10. Changelog
| Version | Date | Changes | Stakeholder | Rationale/Motivation |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| V1.0.0 | 2026-01-13 | Initial priority framework template | Framework Steward | Establish standardized structure for VMS priority documents |

## Usage Instructions

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Substitute all [BRACKETED] placeholders with specific content
2. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the numbered sections and their purposes intact
3. **Customize Algorithms**: Adapt quantitative formulas to the specific priority domain
4. **Add Examples**: Include 2-3 concrete case studies relevant to the priority type
5. **Update Metadata**: Modify ID, Title, Context, Priority Level, and Scope appropriately
6. **Validate Logic**: Ensure decision trees and algorithms are logically sound

## Template Naming Convention
- File name: `PRIORITY_[NUMBER]_[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME].md`
- Reference constant: `PRIORITY_VMS_[ABBREVIATION]`
- Example: `PRIORITY_002_Flourishing_Weights.md`

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] All placeholders replaced with specific content
- [ ] Decision logic is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Quantitative algorithms are mathematically sound
- [ ] Ethical safeguards are comprehensive
- [ ] Case studies illustrate key principles
