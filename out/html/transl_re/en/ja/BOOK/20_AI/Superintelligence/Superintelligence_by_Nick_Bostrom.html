<pre><code>Concentration of Power:
├── Technological Singularity → A single superintelligent entity dominating
├── Decisive Strategic Advantage → The first superintelligence gaining overwhelming power
├── Unilateral Control → One actor controlling the future of civilization
├── Coordination Failure → Competition preventing beneficial outcomes
└── Existential Risk → A misaligned singleton posing an ultimate threat
