## Translations Directory

This directory contains multilingual translations of project documentation, books, and framework models.

### Directory Structure

```
transl/
└── zh/                      # Chinese translations
    ├── 书/                   # Book translations
    ├── 利益相关方人工智能协作模型/  # Stakeholder AI Collaboration Model (Chinese)
    └── 框架模型/              # Framework Model (Chinese)
```

### Purpose

The `transl/` directory serves as the central repository for all multilingual content, enabling the project to reach international audiences and support diverse linguistic communities.

### Current Languages

- **zh (Chinese)**: Primary translation language with comprehensive coverage

## Content Types

### Books (书/)
Contains translations of literature referenced in the project:
- Writing and style guides
- AI ethics and philosophy books
- Technical literature

### Framework Models
- **MODEL_for_STKHLD_AI_COLLAB**: Starter for "Stakeholder AI Collaboration Model" in Chinese
- **MODEL_for_framework**: Starter for "Framework Model in Chinese"

### Translation Standards

- Maintains conceptual accuracy while ensuring natural language flow
- Preserves technical terminology consistency
- Follows cultural adaptation principles where appropriate
- Includes translator notes for complex concepts

### Contributing Translations

To contribute new translations:

1. Create a new language directory using ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., `en/`, `es/`, `fr/`)
2. Mirror the source structure from the main project directories
3. Follow the established naming conventions
4. Include a README.md in the language directory explaining translation scope and contributors

### Maintenance

- Translations should be kept in sync with source document updates
- Version control tracks translation evolution alongside source changes
- Quality assurance processes ensure translation accuracy and consistency
