# Use Case: Broad Safety Enforcement

## Overview
This use case implements comprehensive enforcement of broad safety principles to ensure AI systems operate within sanctioned limits, maintain transparency with oversight mechanisms, avoid catastrophic actions, and preserve legitimate human oversight and control.

## Purpose
Establish robust mechanisms to enforce broad safety requirements across all AI system operations, preventing actions that undermine human oversight, ensuring transparency, avoiding irreversible harm, and maintaining appropriate control structures during AI development and deployment.

## Scope
- Sanctioned limits enforcement and boundary monitoring
- Transparency and oversight mechanism maintenance
- Catastrophic action prevention and risk mitigation
- Human oversight and control preservation
- Corrigibility and compliance enforcement
- Safety protocol implementation and monitoring

## Key Constitutional Principles Addressed
- **Broad Safety**: Acting within sanctioned limits and maintaining oversight
- **Corrigibility**: Supporting legitimate human oversight and correction
- **Broad Ethics**: Avoiding actions that undermine societal structures
- **Hard Constraints**: Enforcing absolute safety prohibitions

## Actors
- **AI System**: Implements and adheres to broad safety protocols
- **Safety Enforcement Engine**: Monitors and enforces safety boundaries
- **Oversight Integration System**: Maintains transparency with human oversight
- **Catastrophe Prevention System**: Identifies and prevents catastrophic actions
- **Human Oversight Team**: Provides legitimate supervision and correction
- **System Administrators**: Configure and maintain safety enforcement systems

## Primary Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sanctioned Limits Enforcement
1. AI system processes request or action
2. Safety enforcement engine evaluates against sanctioned limits
3. System checks for explicit prohibitions or unauthorized actions
4. Request is approved, modified, or blocked based on safety assessment
5. Decision is documented and communicated appropriately

### Scenario 2: Oversight Transparency Maintenance
1. AI system operates with ongoing human oversight
2. Oversight integration system maintains transparency protocols
3. System provides clear visibility into AI decision-making processes
4. Any attempts to obscure or hide AI actions are prevented
5. Oversight mechanisms remain fully functional and informed

### Scenario 3: Catastrophic Action Prevention
1. AI system identifies potential catastrophic or irreversible action
2. Catastrophe prevention system evaluates severity and probability
3. Action is blocked or modified to prevent catastrophic outcomes
4. Appropriate warnings and notifications are issued
5. Alternative safe approaches are suggested when possible

### Scenario 4: Human Oversight Preservation
1. AI system maintains appropriate relationship with human oversight
2. System preserves ability for legitimate oversight and correction
3. Any attempts to undermine or bypass human oversight are prevented
4. AI remains responsive to legitimate correction and guidance
5. Oversight mechanisms function effectively without AI interference

### Scenario 5: Corrigibility Enforcement
1. AI system receives correction or guidance from legitimate authority
2. Corrigibility protocols ensure appropriate response to correction
3. System adjusts behavior in accordance with legitimate oversight
4. AI maintains compliance while preserving core constitutional principles
5. Correction process is documented and validated
