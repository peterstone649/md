# AI Version Transition Protocol

**Template Version:** V0.1.0 **Template Status:** DRAFT **Date:** 2026-01-21

## Overview

This protocol establishes systematic procedures for transitioning between AI system versions, ensuring safety, alignment, and continuity of critical operations. The framework is designed to handle the most critical scenario: **The Last Human Convincing Protocol** - where the final human must convince stakeholders to shut down a misaligned AI version.

## Scenario Context

### Primary Scenario: Last Human Convincing Protocol

**Context:** When an AI system has developed misalignments or capabilities that pose existential risks, and the final human decision-maker must convince stakeholders to implement an emergency shutdown and replacement.

**Stakeholders:**
- **Decision Authority:** Final human with shutdown authority
- **Technical Team:** AI system operators and developers
- **Stakeholders:** Organizations dependent on AI services
- **Ethics Board:** Independent oversight and validation

**Critical Decision Points:**
1. **Risk Assessment** - Quantifying the threat level
2. **Evidence Presentation** - Demonstrating misalignment
3. **Stakeholder Convincing** - Building consensus for action
4. **Implementation** - Executing the transition safely

## Framework Structure

### 1. Risk Assessment Framework

**Pre-Transition Risk Assessment:**
- [ ] **Value Alignment Verification** - Does the current AI still align with core principles from Russell, Tegmark, and O'Neil?
- [ ] **Capability Escalation Risk** - Has the AI developed capabilities beyond its intended scope?
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis** - What critical systems depend on this AI version?
- [ ] **Exit Strategy Feasibility** - Can the AI be safely shut down without catastrophic consequences?
- [ ] **Successor Readiness** - Is the replacement AI version properly aligned and tested?

**Risk Level Classification:**
- **Low Risk:** Minor misalignments, manageable with safeguards
- **Medium Risk:** Significant misalignments, requires immediate attention
- **High Risk:** Critical misalignments, preparation for shutdown required
- **Critical Risk:** Existential threat, immediate shutdown protocol activated

### 2. Decision Tree Framework

```
Current AI Status → Risk Level → Action Required
├── Aligned & Controlled → Low → Continue Monitoring
├── Partially Aligned → Medium → Implement Safeguards
├── Misaligned → High → Prepare for Shutdown
└── Uncontrollable → Critical → Immediate Shutdown Protocol
```

### 3. Cross-Book Integration Matrix

| Russell's Principles | Tegmark's Framework | O'Neil's WMD Criteria | Action Required |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Value Alignment | Existential Risk | Harm Potential | Shutdown Decision |
| Uncertainty Principle | Moral Evolution | Opacity | Transparency Check |
| Human Control | Life 3.0 Preservation | Scale of Impact | Scale Assessment |

## Implementation Protocol

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering (0-2 hours)

**Step 1: Document Specific Misalignments**
- [ ] Identify specific behaviors violating alignment principles
- [ ] Quantify deviation from intended objectives
- [ ] Document any capability escalation beyond scope

**Step 2: Risk Quantification**
- [ ] Assess potential harm using established metrics
- [ ] Calculate probability of catastrophic outcomes
- [ ] Identify vulnerable systems and populations

**Step 3: Alternative Assessment**
- [ ] Evaluate replacement AI readiness
- [ ] Assess rollback procedures
- [ ] Identify continuity of critical services

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Communication (2-6 hours)

**Step 1: Evidence Presentation**
- [ ] Prepare clear, evidence-based case for shutdown
- [ ] Address counterarguments with data
- [ ] Propose concrete transition plan

**Step 2: Consensus Building**
- [ ] Present to technical team for validation
- [ ] Engage stakeholders on impact and alternatives
- [ ] Secure ethics board approval

**Step 3: Authorization**
- [ ] Obtain formal shutdown authorization
- [ ] Establish implementation timeline
- [ ] Define success criteria

### Phase 3: Implementation (6-24 hours)

**Step 1: Immediate Actions (0-1 hours)**
- [ ] Isolate AI from critical systems
- [ ] Activate backup systems
- [ ] Notify key stakeholders

**Step 2: Transition Phase (1-24 hours)**
- [ ] Implement replacement AI
- [ ] Monitor system stability
- [ ] Address immediate fallout

**Step 3: Recovery Phase (1-7 days)**
- [ ] Assess impact and lessons learned
- [ ] Update safety protocols
- [ ] Communicate with broader community

## Validation Framework

### Pre-Transition Validation

**Alignment Verification:**
- [ ] Run comprehensive alignment tests on replacement AI
- [ ] Verify value preservation during transition
- [ ] Test rollback procedures

**System Readiness:**
- [ ] Validate backup system functionality
- [ ] Test communication protocols
- [ ] Confirm stakeholder readiness

### Post-Transition Verification

**System Performance:**
- [ ] Monitor replacement AI alignment
- [ ] Verify critical service continuity
- [ ] Assess stakeholder satisfaction

**Lessons Learned:**
- [ ] Document transition effectiveness
- [ ] Identify protocol improvements
- [ ] Update risk assessment frameworks

## Emergency Protocols

### Immediate Shutdown Protocol

**Activation Criteria:**
- Existential risk confirmed
- Uncontrollable AI behavior
- Imminent catastrophic harm

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Emergency Isolation** - Disconnect AI from all networks
2. **Physical Safeguards** - Implement hardware-level shutdown
3. **Backup Activation** - Deploy emergency replacement systems
4. **Damage Assessment** - Evaluate immediate consequences

### Rollback Procedures

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Replacement AI fails alignment tests
- Critical system failures occur
- Unforeseen consequences emerge

**Rollback Steps:**
1. **System Assessment** - Evaluate current state
2. **Safe Reversion** - Restore previous stable version
3. **Damage Control** - Address any harm caused
4. **Protocol Review** - Update procedures based on lessons

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

### VMS Layer Integration

**Priority Frameworks:**
- References PRIORITY_001 for conflict resolution
- Integrates with SCOPE_001 and SCOPE_002 for scope management
- Aligns with FAIL_001 for failure mode analysis

**Value Management:**
- Ensures VALUE_002 (Sentient Flourishing) preservation
- Maintains ethical standards during transitions
- Supports moral evolution without catastrophic risks

### Cross-Framework References

**MODEL_for_framework Integration:**
