# Abstraction [TERM_FOR_MFW_ABSTRACTION] **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**Version: V1.0.1** **Status: APPROVED** **Date: 2026-01-23**
**Scope:** All framework abstraction processes and cognitive mappings

*   **Abstraction:** The cognitive and epistemological process of selectively focusing on essential characteristics while systematically omitting irrelevant details, enabling the creation of simplified yet meaningful representations that facilitate understanding, communication, and systematic reasoning across different levels of complexity.
*   **Description:** In this scientific framework, abstraction represents the fundamental cognitive mechanism that transforms overwhelming complexity into manageable understanding. It is the essential process that enables humans and systems to create mental models, conceptual frameworks, and systematic representations by identifying what matters most and filtering out what doesn't. Abstraction is both a psychological process and an epistemological tool that makes complex systems comprehensible and actionable. Without abstraction, the complexity of reality would be cognitively overwhelming and practically unmanageable.
*   **Formal Definition:** ∀a (Abstraction(a) ↔ ∃s∃e∃f∃p (Selection(s) ∧ Essential(e) ∧ Filtering(f) ∧ Purpose(p) ∧ CreatesSimplifiedRepresentation(a,s,e,f,p)))
*   **Type Classification:** EPISTEMOLOGICAL / COGNITIVE
*   **Priority Level:** HIGH
*   **Scientific Acceptance:** High (Fundamental to cognitive science, epistemology, and systems theory with extensive empirical validation).
*   **Reference:** [Abstraction (Philosophy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) (WP), [Levels of abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) (WP)
*   **Key Theories:** Cognitive Abstraction Theory (Johnson-Laird), Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff), Hierarchical Organization Theory, Information Processing Theory, Gestalt Psychology
*   **Context:** In this scientific framework, abstraction serves as the foundational cognitive process that enables modeling, framework development, and systematic understanding by transforming complex reality into manageable conceptual structures.
