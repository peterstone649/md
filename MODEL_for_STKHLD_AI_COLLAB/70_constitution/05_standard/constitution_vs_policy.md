# Constitution vs Policy [STD_FOR_STKHLD_AI_COLLAB_CONSTITUTION_VS_POLICY] **[PRIO: HIGH]**

**We establish clear distinctions between constitutional principles and policy implementations to ensure proper governance and operational guidance within the STKHLD_AI_COLLAB framework.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Clarity**: Define clear boundaries between constitutional and policy levels
2. **Governance**: Establish appropriate decision-making authority
3. **Implementation**: Guide proper application of principles vs policies
4. **Consistency**: Maintain alignment between constitutional foundations and policy execution

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
This standard establishes clear distinctions between constitutional principles and policy implementations within the STKHLD_AI_COLLAB framework. Constitutional principles provide foundational, enduring guidance that establishes core values and fundamental rights, while policies offer specific, actionable directives for operational implementation. This distinction ensures proper governance hierarchy, appropriate decision-making authority, and consistent alignment between foundational principles and practical application.
