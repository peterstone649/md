# [NUMBER]. [CONVENTION_NAME] (CONV_FOR_[CONSTANT_FOR_REFERENCE]) **[PRIO: [LEVEL]]**

**Version: V[VERSION]** **Status: [STATUS]** **Date: YYYY-MM-DD**

**We establish [CONVENTION_PURPOSE] that enable [CONVENTION_BENEFITS] across the stakeholder-AI collaboration ecosystem.**

**Objectives:**

2. **Transparency**: Disclose AI involvement in all convention applications
3. **Stakeholder Oversight**: Maintain human validation throughout convention implementation
4. **Quality Assurance**: Validate stakeholder-AI outputs systematically
5. **Framework Alignment**: Ensure conventions align with MODEL_for_stakeholder_AI_collab principles

**Rationale:**
[CONVENTION_RATIONALE - Explain why this convention exists and what problems it solves for stakeholder-AI collaboration, particularly regarding term consistency]

## Core Convention Principles

### **Stakeholder-AI Convention Format**
```
[NUMBER]_[TYPE_CONSTANT]_[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME].[EXTENSION]
```

### **Convention Component Definitions**
- **[NUMBER]**: Sequential identifier (01, 02, 10, etc.) for ordering and uniqueness
- **[TYPE_CONSTANT]**: Standardized convention type identifier (convention, rule, standard, etc.)
- **[DESCRIPTIVE_NAME]**: Clear, concise description using underscores
- **[EXTENSION]**: Standard file extension (.md, .yaml, etc.)

### **Stakeholder-AI Convention Rules**
1. **Format**: All conventions follow the standard naming format
2. **Term Consistency**: Conventions must use consistent terminology across all documents
3. **Consistency**: Conventions must align with stakeholder-AI collaboration principles
4. **Documentation**: All conventions must be clearly documented
5. **Validation**: Conventions must support automated verification
6. **Evolution**: Conventions must allow for systematic updates
7. **Transparency**: AI involvement must be disclosed in all convention applications
8. **Stakeholder Oversight**: Human validation required for all convention implementations

---

## Convention Usage Guidelines

### **Convention Application Rules**
1. **Scope Compliance**: Apply conventions only within their defined scope
2. **Stakeholder Consistency**: Follow conventions uniformly across all stakeholder-AI contexts
3. **AI Disclosure**: Document AI tool involvement in convention application
4. **Validation**: Use conventions to validate stakeholder-AI collaboration compliance
5. **Evolution**: Update conventions following established procedures

### **Convention Categories**
- **Core Conventions**: Fundamental stakeholder-AI collaboration standards (transparency, oversight, etc.)
- **Domain Conventions**: Specific domain standards (content, process, quality, etc.)
- **Special Conventions**: Specialized operational standards (AI tools, validation, etc.)
