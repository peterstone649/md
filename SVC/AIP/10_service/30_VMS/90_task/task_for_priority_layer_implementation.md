# Task for Priority Layer Implementation

**Status:** OPEN

## Overview
This task file outlines the implementation steps for the VMS Priority Layer within the SVC/AIP framework. The priority layer handles value prioritization mechanisms, conflict resolution, and ranking systems.

## Priority Layer Tasks

- [ ] Create conflict assessment algorithms
- [ ] Implement trade-off negotiation protocols
- [ ] Establish minimum threshold requirements

### Priority Resolution Algorithms
- [ ] Design multi-criteria decision analysis framework
- [ ] Implement weighted scoring systems
- [ ] Create conflict resolution decision trees
- [ ] Develop automated priority assignment logic

### Priority Validation Mechanisms
- [ ] Establish validation criteria for priority assignments
- [ ] Create consistency checking algorithms
