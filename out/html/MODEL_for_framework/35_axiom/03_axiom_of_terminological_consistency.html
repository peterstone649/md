    <h1>03. Axiom of Terminological Consistency (AXIOM_TERMINOLOGICAL_CONSISTENCY) <strong>[PRIO: HIGH]</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Version: V0.1.0</strong> <strong>Date: 2026-01-08</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Axiom:</strong> Every framework must maintain terminological consistency through precise definitions, consistent usage, and systematic relationship mapping to ensure conceptual clarity and prevent semantic ambiguity across all framework components and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> We require systematic definition of concepts, consistent application of terminology throughout framework components, and clear mapping of relationships between terms. This axiom establishes that inconsistent or ambiguous terminology creates conceptual confusion, integration difficulties, and framework ineffectiveness, while systematic terminological management ensures conceptual clarity and reliable communication.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Statement:</strong> ∀tc∃d∃u∃r∃c (TerminologicalConsistency(tc) → ∃d∃u∃r∃c (PreciseDefinitions(d) ∧ ConsistentUsage(u) ∧ RelationshipMapping(r) ∧ ConceptualClarity(c) ∧ SystematicConsistency(tc,d,u,r,c)))</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Foundation:</strong> Semantic theory, knowledge representation principles, and empirical evidence from framework failures due to terminological confusion form this foundation, supported by extensive experience with terminology management in complex systems and frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong> We require systematic definition processes, consistent terminology application, and relationship mapping; ad-hoc or inconsistent terminology compromises framework effectiveness and usability.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Knowledge organization, framework documentation, system integration, conceptual modeling, communication standards, quality assurance.</li>
<li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Contributors who ignore terminological consistency create semantic ambiguity, integration failures, communication breakdowns, and framework ineffectiveness; systematic terminology management ensures conceptual clarity and reliable framework operation.</li>
