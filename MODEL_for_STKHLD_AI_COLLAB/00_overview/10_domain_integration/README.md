# Domain Integration

This directory contains the integration layer that connects the AI collaboration system with external domains and services.

## Purpose

The domain integration layer serves as the bridge between the core AI collaboration framework and external systems, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

## Structure

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interfaces for external system integration
- **Event Handlers**: Asynchronous event processing for real-time updates
- **Data Transformers**: Converters between internal and external data formats
- **Service Connectors**: Pre-built connectors for common external services

## Key Components

- **Domain Adapters**: Translate between domain-specific protocols and the collaboration framework
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure compatibility with external systems
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings for external service connections

## Usage

This layer enables the AI collaboration system to:
- Connect with external databases and APIs
- Process events from external systems
- Transform data between different formats
- Maintain compatibility with evolving external services
