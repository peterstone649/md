## AI Integration Framework (Proposed)

### **Stakeholder-AI Collaboration Principle (Suggested)**
```
Proposed AI-Stakeholder Partnership Model:
├── AI as Accelerator → AI tools enhance stakeholder creativity and productivity
├── Stakeholder as Director → Stakeholders provide strategic direction and final validation
├── Quality Assurance → Multi-layered validation ensures AI outputs meet standards
├── Transparency Commitment → Full disclosure of AI involvement and methodologies
└── Responsible Integration → Proper use of AI capabilities for effective outcomes

Note: This framework is a proposed model for future AI integration. Current DRAFT status does not require or implement this framework yet.
```

### **AI Assistance Scale (Proposed)**
```
Suggested Framework Development Statistics (when fully implemented):
├── AI-Assisted Drafting → 85-90% of initial content generation and structuring
├── Stakeholder Refinement → 100% stakeholder editing, validation, and finalization
├── Quality Assurance → Multi-stage validation and cross-referencing
└── Integration Review → Ongoing assessment of AI integration effectiveness

Note: These metrics are proposed targets for full implementation. Current DRAFT status does not have measurable statistics yet.
```
