## User Story

**As a** User of the framework,

**I want to** consume and apply framework principles, templates, and conventions to my work,

**So that** I can create consistent, high-quality documents that align with framework standards.

---

## Description

Users are the primary consumers of the framework. They apply existing principles, follow templates, and use conventions to create their own documents without necessarily creating new framework components. Users need clear guidance, accessible documentation, and reliable templates.

2. **Understand** how to apply framework standards to their work
3. **Use** templates and conventions consistently
4. **Navigate** between related documents efficiently
5. **Validate** their work against framework standards

---
