├── Decisive Strategic Advantage → First superintelligence gains overwhelming power
├── Unilateral Control → One actor controls the future of civilization
├── Coordination Failure → Competition prevents beneficial outcomes
└── Existential Risk → Misaligned singleton poses ultimate threat
</code></pre>
<h2>Philosophical Implications</h2>

├── Suffering-Focused Ethics → Prioritizing reduction of suffering
└── Long-Term Future Ethics → Considering future generations and cosmic timescales
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Decision Theory</strong></h3>
<pre><code>Strategic Decision-Making:
├── Pascal's Mugging → Extreme outcomes require careful probability assessment
├── Fanaticism Problem → How to avoid overvaluing low-probability high-impact events
├── Information Hazards → Knowledge that could enable catastrophic outcomes
