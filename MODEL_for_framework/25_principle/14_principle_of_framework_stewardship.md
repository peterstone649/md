# Principle of Framework Stewardship [PRINC_MFW_STEWARDSHIP] [PRIO: HIGH]

**We establish Framework Stewardship as a core principle defining a neutral guardian role whose primary responsibility is to the long-term health, consistency, and usability of the framework for all users.**

**Objectives:**
1. **Neutrality**: Ensure framework decisions serve the common good of all reusers, not the interests of a single project or stakeholder.
2. **Usability**: Guarantee a high-quality user experience through rigorous testing and validation.
3. **Consistency**: Uphold and enforce all established framework principles, rules, and conventions.
4. **Sustainability**: Guide the long-term evolution, maintenance, and vision of the framework.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all framework components adhere to accessibility standards as defined in the Principle of Accessibility.

## Abstract

**[AI_LOCK]**
The Principle of Framework Stewardship defines the role of the "Framework Steward" (or Maintainer). This role is distinct from a typical contributor; the Steward's primary role is to serve the entire community of users. The Steward ensures the framework remains practical, generic, and robust. This principle prevents the framework from being captured by the specific needs of one project and protects it from architectural decay, ensuring its long-term value and sustainability.

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This principle applies to any individual or group designated as the official "Framework Steward" or "Maintainer" of the `MODEL_for_framework`.

---

## 2. Core Definitions

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Framework Steward** | A designated role responsible for the governance, quality, and long-term vision of the framework. |
| **Primary Reuser** | The concept that the Framework Steward must be the first and most active user of the framework's components, ensuring they are practical and well-designed. |

---

## 4. Rules and Guidelines

1. **Primacy of the Framework**: The Steward's decisions MUST be justified based on the framework's declared principles and long-term health, not the immediate needs of any single project.
2. **Guardian of Convention**: The Steward is the final arbiter on the interpretation and enforcement of all framework conventions.
3. **Accessibility Enforcement**: The Steward should ensure all framework components comply with the [Principle of Accessibility](./12_principle_of_accessibility.md), including WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all generated content and tools.
4. **Onboarding Responsibility**: The Steward is responsible for creating and maintaining clear documentation to help new reusers adopt the framework.
