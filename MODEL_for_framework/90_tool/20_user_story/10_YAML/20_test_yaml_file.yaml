  As a Test User,
  I want to verify that the YAML to HTML converter works correctly,
  so that I can ensure the tool handles various YAML structures properly.

      - "When I run the YAML to HTML converter,"
      - "Then it should generate a properly formatted HTML file."

    steps:
      - "Given the YAML contains all required fields,"
      - "When the HTML is generated,"
      - "Then all fields should be displayed correctly."
