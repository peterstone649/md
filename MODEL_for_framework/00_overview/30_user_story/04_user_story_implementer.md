# User Story: Implementer [US_MFW_IMPLEMENTER] [PRIO: MEDIUM]

**Version: V1.0.0** **Date: 2026-01-09**

**Story ID:** US_MFW_IMPLEMENTER
**Stakeholder:** Implementer

## User Story

**As an** Implementer working in a specific domain,

**I want to** adapt framework principles, rules, and conventions to my domain context,

**So that** I can apply framework methodology to FIELDCscience, FIELDCphilosophy, or other specialized fields.

---

## Description

Implementers apply framework methodology to specific domains. They work within FIELDC* directories (science, philosophy, mathematics, game theory, system analysis, design patterns) and adapt general framework elements for domain-specific use. Implementers bridge the gap between abstract methodology and concrete application.

---

## Goals

1. **Understand** core framework principles and their intent
2. **Adapt** principles to domain-specific contexts
3. **Create** domain-specific conventions and templates
4. **Integrate** with existing framework structure
5. **Document** domain-specific adaptations

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementer understands core framework principles
- [ ] Domain adaptations maintain consistency with parent framework
- [ ] New domain-specific elements follow naming conventions
- [ ] Clickable links connect domain content to framework foundation
- [ ] Domain-specific additions documented and attributed

---

## Implementation Workflow

```
1. ANALYSIS
   └── Study core framework principles
   └── Identify domain-specific requirements
   └── Map principles to domain needs
   
2. ADAPTATION
   └── Select applicable principles
   └── Customize for domain context
   └── Create domain-specific examples
   
3. CREATION
   └── Add domain conventions in FIELDC* directory
   └── Create domain templates if needed
   └── Document domain-specific rules
   
4. INTEGRATION
   └── Link to parent framework elements
   └── Add clickable cross-references
   └── Ensure consistent structure
   
5. VALIDATION
   └── Verify compliance with core conventions
   └── Check link functionality
   └── Review against framework standards
```

| **FIELDCscience** | `_29/FIELDCscience/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **FIELDCphilosophy** | `_29/FIELDCphilosophy/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **FIELDCmathematics** | `_29/FIELDCmathematics/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **FIELDdesign_pattern** | `_29/FIELDdesign_pattern/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **FIELDgame_theory** | `_29/FIELDgame_theory/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **FIELDsystem_analysis** | `_29/FIELDsystem_analysis/` | MODEL_for_framework |
| **Ethosys** | `_29/Ethosys/` | MODEL_for_STKHLD_AI_COLLAB |

## Adaptation Guidelines

### Principles
- Core 12 principles apply universally
- Domain-specific interpretations documented
- Examples tailored to domain context

### Conventions
- Follow framework naming conventions
- Add domain-specific conventions as needed
- Cross-reference framework conventions

### Templates
- Use framework templates as base
- Extend with domain-specific sections
- Maintain structural consistency

---

## Quality Standards

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | Adheres to framework naming patterns |
| **Connectivity** | Links to parent framework elements |
| **Clarity** | Domain context clearly explained |
| **Completeness** | All adaptations documented |
| **Compliance** | Follows active voice and link rules |

---

## Example Use Cases

1. **New Scientific Domain**
   > "We're creating FIELDCscience. I'll adapt the stakeholder-AI principles for scientific research contexts, add domain-specific conventions, and link everything back to the core framework."

2. **Philosophy Application**
   > "FIELDCphilosophy needs domain-specific principles. I'll adapt the framework methodology for philosophical discourse while maintaining consistency."

3. **Custom Domain**
   > "Our organization needs a custom field. I'll use the framework as a template, adapt it to our needs, and document all changes."

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review core framework README
- [ ] Map domain requirements to principles
- [ ] Create domain directory structure
- [ ] Adapt applicable templates
- [ ] Add domain-specific conventions
- [ ] Create clickable cross-references
- [ ] Document domain-specific rules
- [ ] Validate against framework standards

---

## Success Metrics

- Domain implementations pass framework compliance review
- Cross-references functional and complete
- Domain users can navigate to parent framework
- Documentation clearly links to source principles
